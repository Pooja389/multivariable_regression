# multivariable_regression
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of multivariable regression to analyze and predict outcomes based on multiple independent variables.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of multivariable regression to predict outcomes based on multiple independent variables. It serves as a practical guide for understanding and applying regression analysis using Python libraries such as `scikit-learn` and `statsmodels`.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**:
  - Loading and preprocessing datasets.
  - Handling missing values and scaling features.
  - Feature engineering and selection.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizing relationships between variables.
  - Identifying correlations and trends.

- **Model Building**:
  - Implementing multivariable regression models.
  - Training and testing the models on split datasets.
  - Evaluating assumptions like linearity and multicollinearity.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Performance metrics: RÂ², Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
  - Analyzing residuals and diagnosing issues like overfitting.

- **Prediction and Interpretation**:
  - Predicting test data outcomes.
  - Understanding the impact of each feature via regression coefficients.

- **Visualization**:
  - Plotting actual vs. predicted values.
  - Residual and diagnostic plots.
